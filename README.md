# QuickTour

Summary: A quick little app that utilizes the Google Maps and Places APIs

## Installation

Just download the directory and double click the index.html NOT TESTED IN IE

## Usage

Simply type in, with as few words as possible, something you'd like to know about in a place. For example, "bars in nyc", "breweries in Texas" or even something general like "san francisco". QuickTour will gather the relevant results from Google Maps Search Text and then if there are results, use Google Places Detail to get some more granular information.
